### About the application

The application homepage localhost:3000 lists recipes from the contentful API. Every recipe is linked to its details page.
Clicking on the recipe will land the user on a recipe detail view. (/recipe/:id).
User can navigate back to home page by clicking on the logo or the browser back button.

All other icons and buttons on the page are not clickable and have been used for design purpose and are features that can be future enhancements.

The application is responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
